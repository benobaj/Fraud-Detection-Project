# Fraud Detection Project
This project focuses on building a machine learning model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. The goal is to create a predictive model that can classify transactions as either fraudulent or non-fraudulent based on various features, using techniques like Random Forest classifiers.

## Project Overview
- **Data Source**: The dataset contains information on credit card transactions, including the amount, merchant details, location data, and whether the transaction was fraudulent.
- **Model**: The project uses a Random Forest classifier to predict fraud based on selected features.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: The model's performance is evaluated using a confusion matrix, precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy.

## Project Structure
- `data/`: Contains the dataset used for training and testing the model.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks with step-by-step code for building and evaluating the model.
- `scripts/`: Python scripts for data processing and model training.
- `README.md`: This file, explaining the project and its components.
